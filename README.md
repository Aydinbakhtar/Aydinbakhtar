I'm **Aydin Bakhtar**, and I like the way nature deals. I'm interested in Earth System Science and Hydrology. I'm in if it's about Hydrology, Hydroclimatology, Remote Sensing, or Complex systems. Generally, I'm coding in **Python**. But for some projects, I did NetLogo, JS, and MATLAB. as a Hydrologist. My main preference is to deal with hydroclimatic data, but my thesis leads me to understand complex systems and human behavior on the earth. I have a lot of experience working with Precipitation datasets and satellite-driven data; I assess them or use them as model input. If you have a question or Offer cooperation in a related field, please email me.
